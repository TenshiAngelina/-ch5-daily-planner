# <Daily-Planner>

## Description

This website provides a simple calendar app so an employee with a busy schedule can add important events to a daily planner so that they can manage time effectively.

The app shows the current date and hour on the top.
If the user scrolls down, they will be able to see and use timeblocks in 1-hour format showing standard business.
Each timeblock displays the hour, a text area to write down appointments, and a save button.
Each timeblock shows a different color, gray for past time, red for present, and green for future.
The save button will save the text area information into Local Storage.


Through the creation of this app, I learned how to use Dayjs and Local Storage to solve problems in an effective way.
